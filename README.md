SmbcSwipe
=========

Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal cartoons does not have a mobile interface. This project aims to fix that via a bookmarklet.

The bookmarklet attempts to add swipe gesture interaction to the online comic smbc-comics.com. It also zooms to show only the comic.

- Swipe left on the comic to see the previous comic.
- Swipe right on the comic to see the next comic.
- TODO: Swipe up on the comic to see a random comic.



Installation
============
Use index.php or something like it to provide a UI and instructions on how to create the bookmarklet, as well as the actual bookmarklet. 
Once the bookmarklet is installed, go to smbc-comics.com then "go to" the bookmarklet. This activates the javascript in the bookmarklet.

Developing
==========
You'll probably need to change the URL in smbc_swipe_bootstrap.js to point somewhere that you've hosted smbc_swipe.js.
